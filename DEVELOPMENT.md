# ZARVIS Development

## Before coding

1. Read [ZARVIS_MASTER_PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md](./ZARVIS_MASTER_PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md).
2. Identify the current implementation phase.
3. Inspect Web, Android and shared Brain architecture.
4. Inspect permissions, ToolPipeline, voice, notifications and authentication when relevant.
5. Search for duplicate implementations.
6. Preserve existing working APIs.

## Implementation rules

- Keep shared logic centralized.
- Keep platform adapters isolated.
- Never fake execution or progress.
- Never bypass Android security.
- Do not mark a capability WORKING without evidence.
- Add or update tests for important behavior.
- Verify UI state against real backend/tool state.
- Test lifecycle and failure paths, not only happy paths.

## Current engineering gate

**Phase 1 — Android Mobile Access + Permission Intelligence**

Later capabilities must not weaken this permission, policy and verification foundation.
