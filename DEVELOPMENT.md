# ZARVIS Development

## Before coding

1. Read [ZARVIS_MASTER_PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md](./ZARVIS_MASTER_PRODUCT_BLUEPRINT.md).
2. Identify the current implementation phase.
3. Inspect Web, Android and shared Brain architecture.
4. Inspect permissions, ToolPipeline, voice, notifications and authentication when relevant.
5. Search for duplicate implementations.
6. Preserve existing working APIs.

## Implementation rules

- Keep shared logic centralized.
- Keep platform adapters isolated.
- Never fake execution or progress.
- Never bypass Android security.
- Do not mark a capability WORKING without evidence.
- Add or update tests for important behavior.
- Verify UI state against real backend/tool state.
- Test lifecycle and failure paths, not only happy paths.

## Current engineering gate

**Phase 1 — Android Mobile Access + Permission Intelligence**

Later capabilities must not weaken this permission, policy and verification foundation.

## Deploying to Vercel

`vercel.json` serves `web/` as static files and routes `/api/*` and `/health` to
`api/index.ts`, which wraps the same Express app as `backend/src/index.ts`.

Vercel scopes environment variables per environment. A **Preview** deployment (every PR
branch) does not see variables that are set only for **Production**. Set these for every
environment that must work, including Preview:

| Variable | Required | Without it |
|---|---|---|
| `JWT_SECRET` | yes | The API refuses to start. `/health` → 500 `jwt_secret_missing_or_invalid`; every API call → 500. |
| `POSTGRES_URL` (or `DATABASE_URL`) | yes on Vercel | An in-memory store per serverless instance; sessions are lost between requests. `/health` → `database: not_configured`. |
| `POSTGRES_CA_CERT` or `POSTGRES_SSL_MODE=no-verify` | when the database's TLS certificate is not publicly trusted (for example a provider's own CA) | Certificate verification is on by default, so every query fails. `/health` → 503 `database: tls_certificate_untrusted`; guest sign-in → 500. |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | for real AI, TTS and image analysis | AI features fail closed with honest errors; image upload → 503 `image_analysis_unavailable`. |
| `INTEGRATION_ENCRYPTION_KEY` | for GitHub connections in production | GitHub connection is reported unavailable. |

Check a deployment with `GET /health`. It never returns secrets; `database` is one of `ok`,
`not_configured`, `tls_certificate_untrusted`, `auth_failed`, `unreachable`,
`schema_error` or `error`.

The **Live preview API smoke test** workflow (`.github/workflows/preview-smoke.yml`) runs
after each successful Vercel deployment. It calls `/health`, then guest sign-in, then
`/auth/me`, then a "Hi" chat turn against the live URL. For a deployment behind Vercel
Deployment Protection, add the repository secret `VERCEL_AUTOMATION_BYPASS_SECRET`.
